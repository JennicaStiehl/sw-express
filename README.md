# Sweater Weather in Express
## Requirements Overview
```
For this project we want you to practice both professional and technical skills. You should develop a good work flow to communicate and document technical information and take time to create a process for building and testing an Express API.

Below are listed the six endpoints you are expected to create. You will be using Googleâ€™s Geocoding API to retrieve the lat and long for the city and retrieve forecast data from the Darksky API using the lat and long.
